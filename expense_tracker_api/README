# Expense Tracker API

This is the Expense Tracker API, a backend service designed to manage user accounts, handle transactions, and track balances. It is built using Go (Golang) and utilizes various libraries and packages to ensure security, efficiency, and scalability.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Go (Golang)
- **Database**: SQLite (via `modernc.org/sqlite` package)
- **HTTP Router**: chi
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication
- **Cryptography**: bcrypt for password hashing and AES for encrypting refresh tokens

## Project Structure

- `internal/config`: Configuration files and environments settings.
- `internal/db`: Database connection and setup.
- `internal/repositories`: Data access layer for interacting with the database.
- `internal/services`: Business logic layer for handling core application functionality.
- `internal/handlers`: HTTP handlers for managing API endpoints.
- `internal/middleware`: Middleware functions for handling cross-cutting concerns like authentication.
- `internal/jwt`: JWT token generation and validation logic.
- `internal/router`: HTTP routing setup.

## Key Features

- **User Management**: Register new users, authenticate existing users, and manage user details securely.
- **Transaction Management**: Record and retrieve user transactions with income and expense tracking.
- **Balance Tracking**: Maintain and update user balances based on transactions.
- **Secure Authentication**: Implement JWT-based authentication to ensure secure access to user data.
